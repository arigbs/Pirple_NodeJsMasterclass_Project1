First assignment for Node.js Master Class @ https://pirple.thinkific.com

## Simple "Hello World" RESTful JSON API. 

Run: **'node index.js'** in the terminal, in root of project directory to start the server in port 3,000.

Running: **'NODE_ENV=production node index.js'** instead should launch the production server, but this may not work as intended if OpenSSL is not set up right.

Say **hello** by typing the following in the browser and hitting enter: **localhost:3000/hello**

**Ping** the server by typing the following in the browser and hitting enter: **localhost:3000/ping**

Ask for **paper** by typing the following in the browser and hitting enter: **localhost:3000/paper**

Tell the server ***you know nodejs** by typing the following in the browser and hitting enter: **localhost:3000/iknownodejs**

The server is a little **cheeky**, but **that's all we know for now**. ;O)

Thanks for stopping by.
